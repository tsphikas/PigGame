      <h1><strong>Pig Game</strong></h1>
      <p>
        Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne 1945.
        <br/><br/>
        Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score if they roll a 1.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>How To Play</strong><br/><br/>
        &#149 Each turn a player rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold.
        <br/><br/>
        &#149 If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and the turn passes to the next player.
        <br/><br/>
        &#149 If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player continues.
        <br/><br/>
        &#149 If the player chooses to 'hold', their turn total is added to their score, it the becomes the next players turn.
        <br/><br/>
        &#149 The first player to score 100 points or more wins.
