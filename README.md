#Pig Game Project

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne 1945.

Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score if they roll a 1.

-If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and the turn passes to the next player.

-If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player continues.

-If the player chooses to 'hold', their turn total is added to their score, it the becomes the next players turn.

-The first player to score 100 points or more wins.
